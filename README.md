# HITL Requirements Extraction Pipeline

Automated extraction + ML classification of engineering requirements from PDF documents with human in the loop(HITL) validation.

## 📋 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/BhuvanCullen/HITL-Requirements-Extraction.git
cd HITL-Requirements-Extraction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run main pipeline
jupyter notebook Final main code.ipynb

#important
The code in cell-4 of the Jupyter Notebook "Final main code.ipynb" only works on the PDF I have attached, as it was named in the cell-4 code. If you need to test the code on any other pdfs please change the title of the document accordingly.
